### 👨‍💻 About Me

Backend-focused CS Student fueled by a blend of strong coffee and a perpetual need to build things. I primarily write JavaScript (Node.js) and dream in database schemas. I enjoy clean code, tackling complex problems, and occasionally debugging issues that exist only in my mind.

### 🌱 Currently Exploring (And Hopefully Sticking To!)

* **Deep-diving into MongoDB and its ecosystem:** Mastering flexible data structures, aggregation pipelines, and sharding (because one database is never enough).
* **The art of Problem Solving:** Dedicated to consistent practice across platforms (I hope I can stick to that, so I don't have to start all over again every time).
* **Architecting Backend Services:** Learning to design scalable APIs using Express.js and diving into authentication/authorization flows.
